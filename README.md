# Project-3-SQLite-Visualization

In this project, we decided to analyze the movie/TV show streaming platform of Netflix, a multi-billion dollar company that offers its users
access to some of the top rated shows and movies in the nation. Using a dataset of Netflix's top 246 rated shows, we did an in-depth analysis
to see what exactly holds the key to Netflix's continued and prolonged success as the world's go-to streaming platform. 
There were no ethical data restrictions as this Netflix dataset is publicly available information with no API requirements.

Please interact with the script's in this order:

"Jade_Interactive.ipynb", 
"show_demo_info_script.ipynb", 
"Top 10 Shows by Country.ipynb", 
"Top 20 Shows by Genre.ipynb"

"show_demo_info_script.ipynb" : The Purpose of this script is to depict, analyze, and compare the averaged total vote count for each genre of Netflix's top 246 shows.
Within this script, you will see a non-interactive bar-graph that shows each genre and it's respective averaged vote count total and then below it you should be able 
to see the top 10 ranked shows within the dataset. Below that cell, there exists an interactive cell that, when inputted with a Netflix title, will output the respective
title's information and the aggregated total vote count that respective show recieved; then the user can compare that to the bar-graph above. 

References for "show_demo_info_script.ipynb" : I used ChatGPT Version 3.5 to help me generate an initial ipywidget function that would help me create the necessary 
widget for interaction. I did this by giving ChatGPT a snippet of my pandas dataframe and asking it to create a widget that will take in an inputted movie title 
and spit out information about that chosen title. I also used ChatGPT to get an understanding of the syntax regarding Seaborn and how to create barplots
with the Seaborn library and incorporate that into my widget. Link to website: *https://chat.openai.com/*
